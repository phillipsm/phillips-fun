            In this case study we'll walk through the process used define the interface that displays web archives at Perma.cc.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature was implemented in 2017 in the Harvard Library Innovation Lab in Cambridge, MA.

        <p>Create your own web archives at <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>.</p>

        <p>
            Perma.cc is a web service that helps scholars, journals, courts, and others create permanent records of the web sources they cite.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma is used by more than half of the law schools in the US, has been used by a US President and the Supreme Court.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma's core service is simple - input a URL and receive an archive in return.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your archive is stored at your library and is available forever. No more 404s or shifting content.
        </p>
        <p>
            I led the Interaction Design effort on the feature described in this case study, and across Perma generally. I also functioned as a full stack developer by contirbuting Python and JavaScript.

    </div>

    <div class="problem-text">
        <p>
            Presenting an archive of a webpage can be confusing. The biggest concern centers around the URL in your browser's address bar. Under normal use, you'll see a Perma.cc URL in your address bar but the conent of the browsers will be from another site, say Wikipedia..
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping user confusion low is a signficiant challenge - we must clearly label the archive so the user knows they're viewing a backup and not the site of the original publisher.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to avoid user confusion and also avoid being a host for content that is normally stored behind a paywall. We don't want to steal views from creators while trying to keep content stable as the internet shifts below.
        </p>
    </div>

                <p>
                  The web page Perma.cc shows you is a recreation of the original. An archive.

    <div class="solution-text">
        <p>
            Presenting an archive of a webpage generates a number of competing concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user that followed the link to the web archive wants to see the archived webpage - they're after the original content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma needed to clearly let the user know that they were viewing an archive at perma.cc/some-guid even if the contents clearly originated elsewhere.
            Perma could be used as tool to avoid paywalls and direct traffic to the original content provider.

            The interface needed to offer a lot and still stay out of the users way.

        This process will help us explore a broad range of paths forward - we're working hard to avoid local maximums.

        <p>We'll end up with a bunch of bad ideas and hopefully, a couple of good ones. It's important to move quickly through these steps. </p>

            We'll dig into each step below. The high level is about same process I use for most larger interaction design efforts.

            Our team was led by the brilliant Harvard faculty member, Jonathan Zittrain. He initiated the effort, found funding and guided the vision for this web archiving service.
