            In this case study we'll walk through the process used to define the interface that displays web archives at Perma.cc.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature was implemented in 2017 in the Harvard Library Innovation Lab in Cambridge, MA.

        <p>
            Create your own web archives at <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>.

            Perma.cc is a web service that helps scholars, journals, courts, and others create permanent records of the web sources they cite.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's used by more than half of the law schools in North America, has been used by a US President and the Supreme Court.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma's core service is simple - input a URL and receive an archive in return. Your archive is stored at an academic or public library and is available forever. No more 404s!
        </p>
        <p>
            I played the roles of Interaction Designer, Full Stack Developer and Product Designer on the Perma.cc team from 2015 to 2017.

            Presenting an archive of a webpage is a fine balance - you want give the maximum view to the archive replay, but you also need to make it clear that the images and text being displayed are a snapshot from another website.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user is seeking the archive replay and that's it - let's add only the most necassary labels and admin buttons.

          The interface we arrived at uses a thin blue header with a couple of dropdown panels to house admin control and archive metadata.

          We found that first-time users could quickly navigate and comprehend this pattern. And, it met our engineering requirements of being efficient across devices and displays.

        This process is an iterative one. It guides us through a broad range of paths forward and helps avoid arriving at a local maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core thing we're doing here is turning up the variance. We want to produce wild interfaces and then cull the set.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process can be widely applied to software and hardware enhancements. It's served me well for many years over many efforts.

            Output stacks of index cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gather two to a few people around a table and quikcly pitch the problem to be solved. Coach the group a little by telling them that this step of the process should additive and encouraging - it's not the time to think critically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Set a timer for five minutes and ask each person to rapidly generate solutions by writing text and drawing sketches on index cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the five minute timer rings, ask each person to briefly describe the 3 to 8 cards they've generated. Each round of sketch/share should last no more than 15 minutes total.
        <p>
            Conduct three or so rounds. Keep going for an hour or two until the energy starts to curve down.
          </p>
        <p>
            You'll end up with mostly bad ideas, with a few potential gems mixed in. You want to keep a light mood that's freewheelin and one that resembles an improv comedy performance.
