          OpenBooth is a phone booth. A piece of occupiable furniture that creates an aural decoupling from surrounding chatter.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenBooth grew out of a project I started in 2016 at the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, I founded <a href="https://publicgood.studio/" target="_blank">Public Good Studio</a> to fabricate and sell OpenBooths. We currently manufacture OpenBooths in Menlo Park, California.
        </p>
        <p>
          I acted as a Product Designer and an Industrial Designer on this effort.

    <div class="problem-text">
      <p>
        Open offices, libraries and similar working environments often lack single occupancy rooms that support phone calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the general construction costs associated with adding booths is prohibitive for many organizations.
      </p>
      <p>We need a booth for phone calls that is fairly priced, and does not require a general contractor.

    <div class="solution-text">
        <p>
          The spaces for phone calls should be more like furniture than a permanent room - we want to avoid permitting, fire code concerns and construction expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is a piece of occupiable furniture that can be shipped and relocated on site.

      Itâ€™s important to cast a wide net at first - generate a bunch of ideas and potential directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we've generated many good and bad ideas, we begin to narrow until we end up with just one design we can physically prototype.
      </p>

        This is the same process used in the <a href="/perma">Perma Case Study</a>.
